# InsightsFromDataWithBigQuery

This exercise is part of my Data Engineering and Machine Learning Fundamental training provided by Google. ‘Insights From Data With Big Query Challenge Lab’ is a non-guided lab under the quest of ‘Insights From Data With Big Query’ from Google Skills Boost. 

Scenario

You're part of a public health organization which is tasked with identifying answers to queries related to the Covid-19 pandemic. Obtaining the right answers will help the organization in planning and focusing healthcare efforts and awareness programs appropriately.

The dataset and table that will be used for this analysis will be : ‘bigquery-public-data.covid19_open_data.covid19_open_data’. This repository contains country-level datasets of daily time-series data related to COVID-19 globally. It includes data relating to demographics, economy, epidemiology, geography, health, hospitalizations, mobility, government response, and weather.
